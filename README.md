# Research Paper Summarizer
# Objective:
- This project aims to develop an effective automatic research paper summarizer. By leveraging the `summarization pipeline` of `Lamini-T5-Flan-248M`, an open-source large language model (LLM), the system will automatically generate concise and informative summaries that accurately capture key findings and conclusions. This will empower researchers to navigate the ever-growing volume of academic literature with greater ease.
